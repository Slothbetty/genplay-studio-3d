# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT - CREDENTIALS EXPOSED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Sensitive credentials were exposed in GitHub repository

### What Happened:
- The file `start-proxy.ps1` contained hardcoded sensitive credentials
- These credentials were committed to the GitHub repository
- The following sensitive information was exposed:
  - Database connection string with password
  - Email credentials (username and app password)

### Exposed Credentials:
```
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://genplay_user:PDM9kI2Z5AePSMWXnbkCD84nsaN7C8Ve@dpg-d3hiishr0fns73cdtvo0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/genplay_db_w82i
EMAIL_USER: bei.zhao@genplayai.io
EMAIL_PASS: koam pjqe kslh qcip
```

### Immediate Actions Taken:
1. ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded credentials from `start-proxy.ps1`
2. ‚úÖ Added `start-proxy.ps1` to `.gitignore`
3. ‚úÖ Created secure template file `start-proxy.ps1.template`
4. ‚úÖ Updated `package.json` to use `dotenv/config` instead of PowerShell script
5. ‚úÖ Updated script to read from environment variables only

### Required Actions:

#### 1. Regenerate Compromised Credentials (URGENT)
- [ ] **Database Password**: Change the PostgreSQL database password in Render dashboard
- [ ] **Email App Password**: Generate a new Gmail app password
- [ ] **Update Environment Variables**: Update all environment variables with new credentials

#### 2. Clean Git History (URGENT)
- [ ] **Remove from Git History**: Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove the file from git history
- [ ] **Force Push**: Force push the cleaned history to GitHub
- [ ] **Notify Team**: Inform all team members to re-clone the repository

#### 3. Security Audit
- [ ] **Check Access Logs**: Review database and email access logs for unauthorized access
- [ ] **Monitor for Abuse**: Watch for any suspicious activity
- [ ] **Update All Secrets**: Consider rotating all other credentials as a precaution

### How to Set Up Secure Environment Variables:

#### For Local Development:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

2. Run the proxy server:
```bash
npm run proxy
```

#### For Production (Render):
1. Set environment variables in Render dashboard
2. Never commit credentials to git
3. Use Render's environment variable management

### Prevention Measures:
1. ‚úÖ Added `start-proxy.ps1` to `.gitignore`
2. ‚úÖ Created template file for reference
3. ‚úÖ Updated documentation to use environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Added security checks in PowerShell script

### Files Modified:
- `start-proxy.ps1` - Removed hardcoded credentials
- `.gitignore` - Added PowerShell script to ignore list
- `package.json` - Updated proxy script to use dotenv
- `start-proxy.ps1.template` - Created secure template

### Next Steps:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** regenerate all compromised credentials
2. **IMMEDIATELY** clean git history to remove exposed credentials
3. Update all environment variables with new credentials
4. Test the application with new credentials
5. Monitor for any unauthorized access

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This incident requires immediate attention. The exposed credentials should be considered compromised and must be changed immediately.
